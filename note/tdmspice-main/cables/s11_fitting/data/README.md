	ucryomanganlongtwpshieldfloating_s11attempt1_0.0dBm
	ucryomanganlongwire2shield_s11attempt1_0.0dBm

	S11 with end of long shielded twisted pair open.  Three
	configurations ; shield floating, shield connected to return
	at VNA port 1, and VNA connected across one of the twp wires
	and the shield.  Some things I know about this cable;

	Cable is 143.25" long, New England Wire Technologies p/n
	N13-36M-100003-2, Shielded Jacketed Twisted Pair, 36 AWG
	Manganin, 0.0045 FEP, Black-Natural, 44 AWG SS304 BRD, .004
	BLK FEP.

	ucryomangan4ftshieldfloat_50ohm_s11_0.0dBm

	4 ft shorter cable, same construction as 7/20, shield floating
	but pair connectorized on both ends with BNC.  Trying shorting
	and putting 50 Ohm at end of pair (instead of open).

	ucryomangan4ft2_shieldconn1side_fullsparam_0.0dBm
		-> full sparameters for new 4ft NE cable with shield
                   shorted to return wire on one end.  I think port2.
	ucryomangan4ft2_shieldconn_open_s11_0.0dBm
		new ~4ft NE magnanin shielded twisted pair, S11 open
		at end, shield connected at end connected to VNA to
		return.
	ucryomangan4ft2_shieldconnotherend_open_s11_0.0dBm
		-> new ~4ft NE magnanin shielded twisted pair, S11
                   open at end, shield connected at end to return
                   wire, furthest from connection to VNA.
	ucryomangan4ft_noshield_open_s11_0.0dBm
		stripped shield of New England manganin shielded
		twisted pair.  S11, open at end.
	ucryomangan4ft_shieldfloat_fullsparam_0.0dBm
		-> full sparameters for old 4ft NE cable.
